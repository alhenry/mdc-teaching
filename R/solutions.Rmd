```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(data.table)
```

## Data Exploration

```{r read}
# Read data
df <- read_dta("../data/icu_data_research_ready.dta")

df
```



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
